# Overview
In this project, we implemented a convolutional neural network for counting object instances in images. These models are able to precisely estimate the number of vehicles in a trac congestion, or to count the humans in a very crowded scene.In this homework we used Shanghaitech dataset[1] that includes nearly 1,200 images with around 330,000 accurately labeled heads. In this homework, we used Part_B of this dataset, Part B images are taken from busy streets of metropolitan areas in Shanghai.we used the CCNN[2] (Counting Convolutional Neural Network) architecture to be implemented.
